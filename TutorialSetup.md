# Setting up AIOpsLab locally using kind
## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.11
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) - Not necessary but recommended for monitoring the cluster

## Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/AIOpsLab
cd AIOpsLab
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
cd AIOpsLab
poetry env use python3.11
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" # export poetry to PATH if needed
poetry install # -vvv for verbose output
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell # installs poetry shell plugin
poetry shell
```

Create `config.yml`
```bash
cd aiopslab
cp config.yml.example config.yml
```
Update `config.yml` so that `k8s_host` is `kind`. It should look like this:
```yaml
# Kubernetes control node
k8s_host: kind
k8s_user: your_username # Username doesn't matter when using kind

# ssh key path
ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Replace with your ssh key path

# Directory where data files are stored
data_dir: data

# Flag to enable/disable qualitative evaluation (makes LLM calls)
qualitative_eval: false

# Flag to enable/disable printing the session
print_session: false
```
Go back to the root directory:
```bash
cd ..
```

Setup kind cluster:
```bash
# For x86 machines
kind create cluster --config kind/kind-config-x86.yaml

# For ARM machines
kind create cluster --config kind/kind-config-arm.yaml
```

## Running AIOpsLab
Run the "human agent" interface:
```bash
python cli.py
```
You should see output like this:
```bash
